This is a console based hangman game coded in the C language. It was made as a way of revising the c language and basic programmig concepts as well as data structures. It implements the linked list data structure to create wordlists, and choose random words for the game. There are 2 header files included in the src folder. One includes the necessary functions needed for the linked list structure while the other contains the game functions. The game has 3 levels, 'easy', 'medium' and 'hard'. The default level is medium. The user can create their own list or choose to play using the pre-existing list. The program will guide the user in either choice and give feedbacks when necessary. Possible improvements in later versions could be adding hints and categories and creating larger word lists.
